val request = HttpRequest("GET", new URI("https://examplebucket.s3.amazonaws.com?max-keys=2&prefix=J"))
val signer = Signer(region = "us-east-1", service = "s3", AwsCredentials(ACCESS_KEY, SECRET_KEY))

val signature =
  signer.sign(
    request,
    contentSha256,
    Header("Host", "examplebucket.s3.amazonaws.com"),
    Header("x-amz-date", "20130524T000000Z"),
